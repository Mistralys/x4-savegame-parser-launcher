# X4 Savegame Parser : Launcher

This small app can be used together with the [X4 Savegame Parser][]
to simplify configuring and running the savegame monitor and viewer. 

## Quick Start

1. Start the app.
2. Go into settings, fill out all paths.
3. Launch the monitor or viewer from the launcher.

## Credits

The app is built with Tauri and React, and developed entirely
using agentic coding techniques with [Roo Code][]@[Visual Studio Code][]
and Gemini 3. The entire development plan is archived under 
[ImplementationArchive][] if you want to see how it was built.
